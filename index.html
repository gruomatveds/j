<p>I know that human memory is imperfect, with a tendency to fill in missing gaps with false information, so, if you actually are a creepy, stalker fucker reading this, take anything below with a grain of salt. This will be mostly a recollection of some of my internal demons and things I will likely regret putting out there in the open, but I suppose you're only as sick as your secrets.
</p><p>
I was born on a Sunday morning of February 1991, in a hospital, in some Eastern European rural hell hole called Līvāni in Latviя.
</p><p>
Earliest memory I have is one of being stuck on my backside, unable to escape or move away, so very hot, bright sunlight literally burning out my retinas, I'm trying to close my eyes to minimize the pain, but, because the light can still travel through my eyelids, I keep seeing that red glow of blood in my capillaries. In a nutshell, my earliest memory is one of slowly burning alive, unable to escape or relieve my suffering, kind of ironic when I think about it.
</p><p>
I remember being in kindergarten, somewhere in Riga I suppose, probably a stereotypical mommy's first born, only child in family, spoiled brat, most precious and unique creation, in my mother's hopes - wunderkind of some sorts. I think I was being a real dipshit asshole taking a toy or something from this one other kid, however, the entire situation was disrupted by the mother or other guardian who saw the mistreatment of her child. As a 29-year-old adult, I can finally admit that I might have truly been wrong, I am sorry that I didn't know how to share a toy. I believe this woman interrupted the scene and started hysterically shouting at me in Russian. I suppose the Russian only speaking teacher also got involved at some point. Being a small child and not understanding a single word in Russian or even the context of the situation, without any real point of reference, I didn't understand how to interpret this act of adult aggression that was aimed towards me. Later in life, I was informed by my mother, that during the time in that kindergarten, I developed a speech impediment and started to stutter. Even though the 90's kindergarten prison food sucked, getting lice was a shitty experience and the rumpus room was deafeningly loud, I remember legitimately enjoying socializing and interacting with other kids of similar age and intelligence. Surely, there were kids who tried taking advantage of me as well, but those are the lessons you want a kid to learn in a physically safe environment, on their own, during childhood. I didn't return to that kindergarten, which ultimately felt as a punishment, it was my fault I was unable to assimilate with Russian speaking kids well enough and started to stutter my speech, so I was being punished for it by not being allowed to play with those other kids anymore. My social awkwardness, to this day, is crippling my ability to find employment.
</p><p>
I remember the tiny kitchen in the rented city apartment during my early childhood, where my father would openly demonstrate the sexual nature of his relationship with my mother. My mother would make these painful screams, shout something like: "NO! STOP IT!", which in turn made my father even more horny and even more sexually aggressive and persistent. As a small child I learned that love is when male overpowers his bitch, bites her ears and sticks his tongue in her orifices, if the woman protests and struggles, it means she likes it very much, no suddenly means yes, the male must overpower his stupid whore wife because obedient housewife bitches like being aggressively dominated by a slimy faggot. It was very confusing seeing my mother being obviously distressed and screaming, but afterwards, trying to explain to me that what I just witnessed was normal, it was just a game, just a joke of some sorts. For the first half of my life, this type of relationship hierarchy based on toxic masculinity, was ingrained in my brain as normal and totally acceptable. I was forced to live with two horny degenerate parents in a small 1-bedroom apartment. My father has always been bragging and expressing huge sense of accomplishment for being a victim of hazing when he served in soviet army, it gives him moral superiority in any argument and is a free pass for his own toxic behavior. I am labeled entitled generation of pussies because I missed out on soviet army experience. Soviet army during cold war was mostly preoccupied with hazing and rape, so a lot of butthurt assholes born in soviet wonderland blame my generation for skipping this educational experience that shapes real manly men.
</p><p>
Before starting pre-school, I was even further more isolated, when my parents decided to move away from the city, where people are shitty, to some hillbilly, Eastern Yurop, no decent schools or jerbs, middle of nowhere shithole. Almost everyone has some sort of distinctive activity and smell related to their childhood. For me, during summer, it was burning ants with grandmother's magnifying glass I would steal and the smell of burnt insects, during winter, it was scraping nonsense on the frozen parts of glass window panes and that sickening, chemical smell of soggy paint after all that ice would thaw and melt on the window sill.
</p><p>
I remember my parents asking which one was my favorite, I don't remember what I answered, but I have always considered my parents to be this singular unit, to fair, I never really saw them as parents, more like my owners. I remember having "the talk" with my owners, where they explained to me that currently they are my only and best friends, that I can never ever truly trust anybody else, yada yada yada I mean who the fuck does that to a child? Long story short, as an adult, I have massive trust issues that are not only ridiculous but also unhealthy. You can't give birth to or adopt a child and forcefully condition him to be your best friend for life, it doesn't work that way, you will only gain the opposite effect by holding someone hostage their entire lifetime.
</p><p>
I have always hated sharing a car ride with my parents. One time my dad put some blankets on the car floor, I remember it being uncomfortable and vomit inducing experience, my dad gave me the very expensive, precious and luxurious "LEGO®" bricks to keep me busy during the drive. My father has always believed in buying only the best and highest quality items that will serve a "lifetime", even if it meant compromising on sufficiency. Buying me box of lego bricks was nothing more than a pathetic way of my parents to boost their own egos and for fucking years constantly remind me that during my childhood they got me the real deal Lego bricks and not some knock-off buildingblocks, but I digress. The reason that even made me remember that car ride was the incredibly sharp pain whenever a piece of lego would end up below my knees, all because my dad was driving like he's doing his best lap around Nürburgring. I remember him boasting to my mom with proudness, how he came up with this great idea, how to keep me miserable and frustrated the entire car ride, however, the best story is the drive home from one of the very few times I met my cousins. So my dad was drunk, I don't really understand how was my mother okay to get in the car with him and endanger her child to begin with, but, only during the drive back home, my mother started one of her psychotic episodes, either she or my grandmother also encouraged me to pray to god. Being the borderline autistic, brainwashed, Catholic kid, I think I went into this full-blown panic attack, praying to god to not let my drunk father kill us all in a car crash. I might not be giving my father the credit he deserves, being shitfaced, driving with a woman and child who are having a full-blown mental meltdown psychotic episode, through all that screaming and crying, he managed to finish the journey without doing any damage to the vehicle or getting caught by the police. Remembering incidents like this, that always ended well in the end, would make me despise my parents for their lifelong hypocrisy of do as I say and not as I do.
</p><p>
I have always had a sweet tooth, but even candy was a source for guilt tripping and shaming in my degenerate family. If my parents would give me a snickers bar, it would come at the price of endless guilt tripping how this singular piece of candy costs as much as regular people earn in a month at their factory job, so I should be eternally grateful that my father works 3 jobs, steals or is hustling booze to afford such delicacy as a singular snickers bar, being born at the wrong time makes me entitled and ungrateful. In my childhood fucking Mars chocolate bar came at the cost of many hours of guilt tripping and sense of eternal debt to my providers. I would rather not experience the taste of western candy than be forced to take in all that demented 90's post-soviet degenerate bullshit from my "generous" providers.
</p><p>
My mother kept bringing up a story from my childhood to prove that I am a gullible, dumb piece of shit. One time during early childhood around Christmas time my mother would put candy in the fur of the dog and make me search for it and tell me it's gnomes or some shit hiding it there. I wasn't blind or mentally retarded, I saw her putting it there, I was a small child who simply loved sweets, so I played along my demented piece of shit cunt of a mother, digging out the candy from dirty dog's fur, unwrapping it, then eating it. Sure, tell a child to do something, proceed to laugh about him being a gullible, feeble-minded piece of shit, keep reminding him that for decades, nothing bad will come out of it.
</p><p>
My mentally ill mother is obsessed with pharmacology, she thinks that for almost any human condition there is a magical molecule in a pill form or it needs to be invented. Even as recently as some month ago this demented cunt was demanding that I open the door or her Russian degenerate husband will break it down and they will force feed me some expired Diazepam or whatever, so that I feel better. You see, my mother has diagnosed me with depression, and she has magical pills that will fix my head. I can't live like this, this is fucking insanity. My mother has obsession to read up on illnesses, finding something that she thinks fits her vibe and she actually manifests those textbook symptoms, her shitty lifestyle and diet doesn't help either.
</p><p>
There was a period in my childhood when my parents denied me access to the toilet on the 1st floor during night time, something about not letting the stank out, so instead, they forced me to urinate in a glass jar totally in the open for them to enjoy. If the entire thing wasn't already fucked up and dehumanizing as it was, I remember at one point my parents started poking fun at me for being little dumb shit pissing in his piss jar. Even before all this, either I had some serious mental development issues or it was the early signs of my mother cultivating artificial dependency, I think literally for many, many years I was not taught how to wipe my own shitty ass. I remember learning and being allowed to wipe my own ass as a huge accomplishment, because it meant I could finally use the toilet on my own for the first time ever.
</p><p>
I vividly remember the sharp pain whenever my father would stab me in the asshole, through my pants, with his fingers. He would do this when I was taking too long to walk up the stairs, so his solution was to force his fingers up my corn hole and keep pushing, as if lifting me up the stairs with the force of his fingers pushing hard on my anal opening trough the sheer fabric of my pants. I couldn't make this shit up even if I wanted to, this was 100% real part of my childhood and most likely also early teen years. It wasn't so much disgusting and humiliating as it was incredibly painful. As an isolated kid with no friends or point of reference, I did not understand how fucked up this was, in my mind, it was a game, if I was too slow and in front of my father on a flight of stairs, I would get painfully stabbed in my brown eye as a punishment. Such is Latvian peasant life I guess. One time I came up with a cunning plan, when my father was pushing his finger up my asshole, I pretended to fall, I might have banged my legs for real, it wouldn't have been the first time I had bled because I banged my leg against the metal frame of the metal stairs, but my father instantly called me out for faking it which got me in more trouble for being a little bitch ass faggot drama queen.
</p><p>
My elementary school teacher would always say to boys that they are crying crocodile tears, that is how I learned that men aren't allowed to feel pain.
</p><p>
I remember always hating holding my father's slimy, sweaty hands in public, so as a compromise, he would keep his sweaty palm rested on the backside of my neck, a constant reminder that he could snap my child's neck like a twig, I have been afraid and terrified from that massive, lard ass giant, incest loving monster my whole life.
</p><p>
For some fucked up reason, I don't really recall playing or meeting with other kids during my childhood that much. I believe my first sexual experience was when my father was "playing" with me, he was laying on top of me, his massive weight pushing on my backside, crushing my ribcage to a point where after exhaling I was unable to breathe in again, so I physically couldn't scream. I believe the entire ordeal ended when my father was so turned on that he started sliding his tongue in my ear canal, which made me very disgusted and upset. My mother, who was enjoying watching the whole incest action unfold before her eyes, tried to resolve the issue by saying something along the lines: "It was tickled, it laughed, it means it liked it, it was only a finger. Get over it, it was just a joke! Admit it you actually fucking liked it you little faggot.". This is the earliest memory I can recall seeding my fetish for BDSM, erotic asphyxiation and roleplaying a fantasy of being bonded, raped and killed. I also have developed this unnatural sexual enjoyment from latex, mostly from childhood fascination with latex gloves I was playing with.
</p><p>
I will never forget my first memorable computer experience. When my father bought a desktop computer set that had, at the time, supposedly top shelf hardware like a Pentium III CPU, Riva TNT32 graphics card and a 128MB stick of SDRAM. I think it might have been around the very beginning of the year 2000, details are blurry, but I was very well informed by my mother that the computer set had cost well above thousand lats, I can't recall the exact number even if my life depended on it, but she might as well have said thousand golden rubles, which would at least be tied to a physical gold standard, either way, having no understanding about the value of some shitty fiat currency, I thought it was more money I would be able to make in my entire lifetime and I would never be able to repay it back to my father, if, by my fault, something would happen to the precious personal computer. It was a nice piece of hardware the year it was bought, even though my dad might have overpaid for it twofold, not to mention the entire thing became old, garbage, not even museum worthy, piece of shit junk, traded away by my dad for pirated copies of some terrible Latvian software, long before I could actually find practical use for it, got access to the internet and learned to pirate the things I couldn't afford to buy, but I digress. When that computer was still like brand new, this one unlucky day I was left alone with it and Windows98 operating system "froze" and for some reason the beeper/speaker on the  motherboard got stuck in eternal loop, making this never ending, high pitched sound of nightmares for an entire hour, an hour that I spent seriously contemplating running away from home or making a suicide, all to avoid the unimaginable wrath of my dad when he would find out that I "broke" his precious thing by pushing a wrong button.
</p><p>
My parents instilled fear in me by explaining that they have the potential to fuck me up like it was done to my father and mother by their soviet parents, but being the kind Russian giant my father is, he would spare me from beating as long as I behave. My entire life is this constant, never ending fear and feel of terror, knowing that Russian monster father figure is able to snap at any second.
</p><p>
While the overpriced, top shelf, high end, useless computer with no software or internet access was one the most painful, guilt tripping, shame and eternal debt inducing gifts from my parents, even before that I was guilt tripped for having a TV. For a very brief while when we were living in the city where people are shitty, the cable TV would allow me to watch cartoons, in English, there is something immensely cruel about it. I was at an age to understand concept of dialogue and plot, except all I saw were these colorful characters talking nonsense and doing nonsense. I'm sure my mother thinks that leaving a small child in front of a TV box that talks English for days on end is one of the main reasons I'm somewhat proficient in English. Fucking piece of shit cunt. I understand a lot of people don't give fuck about their kids and they hate spending time to teach them anything, but why would you give a small preschool child his "own" TV that speaks completely alien language and has no practical use for him?
</p><p>
During middle school I attempted playing this one stupid game with my classmate, we would punch each other in the shoulder, taking turns, each time upping the force by some increment, the one who makes the last punch is the winner, the one who gives up and doesn't retaliate is the loser. The game was incredibly stupid, but that, for many days sore, black and blue shoulder, gave me a valuable life lesson of not falling for the spiteful mentality of fighting to death, only to have the last word and final saying in almost any matter of life or relationships. It's so much more productive to let go, instead of falling for the self destructive cycle of getting stuck in eternal loop of self-pity and failing to achieve some sociopathic moral high ground. Initially this experience got lost on me once I had to stress out at least for a week while hiding my shoulder from my body inspector, body shaming mother. Finding something wrong and body shaming is huge part of my family dynamic and culture. Only at the age of 25 or 26, for the first fucking time in my life I picked up jogging, started to do some simple exercises that don't require any equipment and my family would crack dumb jokes, criticize my attempts of whatever I was doing, straight up say the things I do are wrong and harmful for me and continued to body shame me. My mother believes that operating Husqvarna 55 chainsaw without any protective gear, chopping wood, stacking wood, moving lawn and cleaning snow are the only exercises a healthy male needs, anything else is harmful and haram. My family thinks that any type of body building activity is for city dwelling faggots or something. Energy and time wasted on my own wellbeing is time and energy robbed from my mother to slave away at her incestuous horror house.
</p><p>
At one point, during my pre-school years, my mother set up a play date for me and this much younger neighbor kid, so I would have someone to hang out with. I never learned to like him, he was much younger and had some mental retardation written all over him, however, I really got in to the, at the time popular, Japanese cartoons for kids or something. I simply wanted to be able to relate to that neighbor kid more, for what my father would proceed to shame an scold me at the dinner table, because he overheard me having conversation with my "friend" in the apple tree garden, while my poor daddy was trying to sleep on the second floor of the house by the open window. I guess my dad was grumpy and tired from sleepless night of stress, caused by stealing from his workplace so that he could provide. This is one of many instances of hating family dinners around the same table because of my toxic, always yapping, piece of shit, multigenerational, under the same roof, so called "family". Anyway, I don't know why, I simply didn't like hanging out with that neighbor kid that much, maybe it was his family culture and dynamic that was completely different from mine. At the end of the day, for me it was a rather simple choice of either playing with someone much younger who I didn't really like or playing with inanimate objects like rocks. To be honest, even to this day, I find the entire concept of casual friendships totally alien.
</p><p>
I was not allowed talking to anyone about family business, if I would talk I knew my parents would go to jail and I would become homeless, freeze and starve to death in the winter. At least that was my worldview, I didn't understand that my father is a piece of shit thief and molester, as a kid I was forced to truly believe that my father is the smartest person alive and world's greatest provider a family could have.
</p><p>
I remember being called a psychopath by my parents or at least by my mother on a very regular basis during my childhood. I'm not the brightest or most motivated individual, the only thing I have learned about this particular personality disorder is that, people, who are suffering from it, literally can't feel empathy or remorse and lead a parasitic lifestyle. I wish I was an actual psychopath or a sociopath, so I wouldn't have to be guilt tripped in to feeling all this constant emotional pain, in all actuality, I might have a borderline personality disorder, except, the cause for it is being a sick pet project for an actual sociopath and his enabler. How's that for some food for thoughts? God, my mother cooks disgusting, her lard ass has zero concept of healthy and balanced died, whenever I try using her kitchen during day time she keeps bitching and moaning about me doing something wrong and keeps guilt tripping me for not eating her over salted, oily garbage instead. The first wakeup call I had was in trade school, for some health related class I had to do a small report on my own diet and how it compares to textbook requirements. When I asked for help on my homework my mother was absolutely useless, I ended up making shit up and lying on that paper. Now I realize I should have done the homework honestly so that I could see the malnourishment proven on paper, except it's hard to face facts when they paint a picture of being abused and controlled by hard core soviet time degenerates that base their diet around the idea of upcoming years of famine and maxing out calories per every money unit spent.
</p><p>
My entire childhood I was brainwashed and fearmongered by my parents into believing that most children didn't have their own rooms, they slept on cold concrete floors and used bodies of other siblings to stay warm, they only ate lentil soup and rotten potatoes, their parents were all drunk Russians who beat the living shit out of them on a daily basis, at least this was the overexaggerated impression that was created in my childish mind, however, I never really saw with my own eyes how other kids lived. I have been guilt tripped into believing that by being born I am guilty for denying my parents a chance to emigrate after the iron curtain fell, that it is somehow my fault that my parents have not been able to pursue education and white collar careers and of course the classic, that my parents have sacrificed everything for me.
</p><p>
During my elementary and middle school years, in the school I was forced to attend, there were couple of teachers/workers, who upon meeting me, questioned me if I'm a son of so and so, after learning I'm son of this one particular piece of shit cunt, that they were teaching back in the good old soviet times, those few teachers, for fucking years would go out of their way simply to belittle and humiliate me publicly in front of my classmates, give me a lower grade than the kid who totally copied my answers, deny me access to some old, used textbooks from library unless I did fixed amount of hours of forced labor, you know, petty revenge for the sins of my family or something, I don't really know or care anymore. I know that I reached out to my parents that I'm straight up being bullied by a teacher, which in the grand scheme of things backfired for me, snitches get stiches and so on. My parents made a huge fucking fuss about it, but didn't gain any real conclusion or solution to issue at hand. I remember that my mother befriended most of my middle school friends and would talk shit about them and their "degenerate" families in front of me. I've never had any opportunities to create and maintain friendships or other relationships, casual or professional, without my parents and grandparents breathing down my neck and background checking everything.
</p><p>
First time I kind of befriended someone was in elementary school, having stupid childlike fun after school I ruined my "good" clothes with grass stains and maybe ripped a stich. When I came home and my piece of shit unemployed father saw the damage, he spent what in my child's mind felt like an eternity, questioning and shaming me: "Do YOU have a brain in that head of yours?!" "Why did you do that?" "Are you capable of a logical thought with that shit bucket for head?" "Can you think for yourself?" "If everybody jumps will you follow!?" "Are you fucking stupid or something?" etc. The wording might have been a little different, but as a kid, the only thing I learned from the entire ordeal was that making friends and having fun is prohibited, my precious clothing is worth more than my wellbeing or my life. To this day my father has hard coded in my brain that I am an idiot! As an adult, I can't accept compliment at its face value, I either see it for the sarcastic mockery that it is or I see someone who is most likely only pretending friendly to advance some sort of hidden agenda.
</p><p>
After my dad had cancer, my mother started working in retail and got herself a driver's license to drive to work in comfort and timely fashion, all against my father's protests, I might add. My father was one of those pieces of shit that proudly said: "My wife will never have to work!". Having her own money for the first time in her life, my mother felt like demonstrating her social status and above average purchasing power by buying me clothing that she liked. It was always this huge, once a year ordeal of sickening car ride to Riga to buy overpriced clothing. I fucking hated those turtle neck, itchy, uncomfortable, long sleeve, thick, always too hot, sweating indoors, going outdoors in freezing cold with sweaty shirt under those clothes that, I guess in my mother's mind, looked cute and comfy. I hate her so much for all the suffering she caused me. In her mind, she was playing dolls or something, dressing up her baby toy in thick layer of prutty clothing. That baby toy was and is a human being, who was extremely uncomfortable and ultimately had trouble seamlessly fitting in with other kids. The icing on the cake was the time my mother forced me to wear these cheapest, ugliest, itchiest, extremely uncomfortable, ill fitting tights, for warmth during mild Latvian winter that I spent constantly sweating balls indoors. When I revealed said tights in the boy's locker room before gym class, it took like one second before I was called out: "Nice granny tights, FAGGOT!". Thank Allah it didn't stick as there was only one boy in my class who was even smaller and tinier than me. I think ever since that poor kid shit his pants during class he became the go to, easy target for bullying. I always felt bad for him, but wouldn't intervene to avoid backlash. I often find myself relating to him in the need for sociolization, even if it comes at the cost of knowing that everyone is actually laughing at you and not with you. I find that alcohol helps, as it removes all the feel of shame, but I also tend to make a fool of myself mostly when drunk. Even as an adult, I dress myself and look like some 6th grader. I almost never buy clothing items that I actually like, it's always some type of compromise of finding something that will be good enough and is reasonably priced, well ok, the human in me sometimes allows me to splurge and buy a silk tie or two for a few euros, if and when I get lucky to catch a sale on amazon.de Jeff, please, send food.
</p><p>
For the first half of my life, every time I got sick, I was being fed antibiotics like I'm some kind of a swine on a farm, living in my own filth, being required preventative measures to limit the possibility of bacterial infection before it has occurred. To be honest, as a child I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland, eating and drinking everything my parents would give me, not questioning their superior authority. As a child, I always found the story and illustrations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to be creepy nonsense, some straight up nightmare fuel, It was only in my twenties, after discovering song White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane, when I got hooked on the idea that behind that novel might be a dark subplot about dangers of substance abuse and blindly consuming drugs given to you by other people. My mother is convinced that my good teeth are partly from those few times when she gave me some sketchy fluoride tablets that I swallowed in less than 30 seconds.

For what feels like a lifetime, my unemployed degenerate father would always stay up late, watch TV and cook food with his stupid cunt wife and of course the shouting and screaming contests are regular occurrence in my mother's incestuous horror house, her disgusting hyena laughter, shit talking about relatives and "friends", anyway, during school nights the smell of burnt shit and all the ruckus from the kitchen would keep me wide awake, so my parents would allow me to hang out with them till very late in the night. That shit was killing me, I would be falling asleep during school, I couldn't focus on my homework and lost appetite because I was sleep deprived, the cycle would repeat daily, thankfully, I could sleep in till noon during weekends and holidays. The thing I spent fantasizing most during childhood was getting home and taking a nap because my piece of shit unemployed father and other family degenerates didn't have to abide by work or school schedule. Male figure examples in my life have all been unemployed professional alcoholics and degenerates with a sprinkle of domestic violence and abuse.

My mother would always shame me and guilt trip me for being a sickly child. On average it took around one week of her bitching and complaining that I haven't been sick in a while and the stress would work its way to my immune system. I would get so stressed out about missing school work, still being required to do the tests I missed, having to stay after classes, catching up on assignments etc. it all would be enough for me to be constantly anxious, lose sleep, lose appetite to a point where I would go down with common cold or anything else that would take advantage of a child's weakened immune system. When I handed official document from my doctor to one of my teachers, she called me out and said that my asthma diagnosis was bullshit and I'm a simulant. The teacher wasn't technically wrong about the diagnosis, but the health related issues like constant shortness of breath because of bad posture combined with shallow breathing and suffocating when attempting to run for the first time in my life, that was for real.

I remember being prescribed bronchodilator medication, some other relatively healthy kids were prescribed them as well, but most parents didn't bother spending money on medication they couldn't afford, all in all it was nothing more than a sham, a scheme to force gullible parents buying relatively harmless, but very overpriced inhalers, so the doctor who prescribed them could go on all expenses covered vacations, sponsored by some pharmaceutical distributor. I didn't have asthma, I was a typical lazy ass kid who didn't do any sports and was sitting locked away in the house all day, closely monitored by helicopter parenting and grandparenting. I believe this happened around the same time my father was going through his chemotherapy cancer treatment, so at some point my mother made sure to guilt trip me, tear up and act the victim, because I turned out to be another, useless, sickly, terminal illness attracting, weakly, manlet in her life, who will inevitably die and leave her alone and miserable. My mother was so convinced that there was something physically wrong with me that multiple times she would take me to these witchdoctors who claimed to have some magical healing superpowers, these males would ever so gently feel up my body for a minute or two, do some witchcraft or whatever, after that, my mother would give money to them. I remember the poorly lit apartment, the witchdoctor was gently groping me, the disgusting body odor of sweat and cheap cologne made me feel sick, in the kitchen there were cries of a small child, kitchen TV was showing Teletubbies, I guess the witchdoctor's wife/bitch in the kitchen was giving black market industrial grade silicone and motor oil injections for that brazilian lift, I don't know, I was only a child. That Russian "family" apartment looked worse than those American crack houses they show on TV. When you bring your child to a drug den to be groped by a Russian paedophile "doctor", at least ask them to pay you and not the other way around, mom! One of the last more memorable times my mother tried to find something physically wrong with me was when I was maybe around the age of 17, she took me to this oncology specialist, there was a point where my eyes met with the young female doctor, in that moment it almost felt like we both were on the same ESP wave and we both knew that my mother is a total fucking nutcase and that the entire situation makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, the doctor explained that she sees nothing wrong with me, all the blood tests came back normal, but the doctor was kind enough to inform us that I can revisit other specialists and request more complicated tests, by my own initiative, as an adult, when I turn 18. I never did.

During my early childhood, in the middle of one night, my mother woke up with massive stomach pain, she was rushed to a hospital where emergency surgery was performed to fix her ruptured appendix. As she retold the entire nightmarish experience to me later in life, the procedure was done by the only available and qualified soviet era surgeon, my mother was given only some insufficient local anesthesia, during surgery the doctor and nurses made verbal fun about her genitals and attempts of struggle from the pain she was experiencing. During the entire surgery she was completely awake and conscious. As the surgery was carried out my mother was ridiculed and humiliated, she is quite certain that the surgeon was poking around to purposefully cause even more pain, just for the fun of it and proceeding to shout at her for moving around too much. My mother did not pursue any legal action against said surgeon or nurses, she took the entire experience as deserved because she is only a woman and she did not have enough money to bribe the doctor and nurses for a better service. After this life lesson my mother would guilt trip me for the time, she and my dad had tricked a child surgeon in thinking that he would get a bribe after surgery, in exchange, I, as a small child, would be put under, to remove a benign growth in my right hand wrist, an operation that would normally be performed with local anesthesia. I remember waking up after the operation feeling really sick, I was hungry so my mother, against the doctor's instructions, gave me a sweet roll and something to drink at the hospital's cafeteria, all of which I quickly proceeded to vomit out and be shamefully rushed out to the car. To this day I don't believe or trust Latvian state sponsored health care system, a lot of the specialists are not readily available, the symbolic payments to prevent freeloaders abusing the "free" healthcare system makes it unavailable to the lowest income households in my country. I do get my free tetanus and diphtheria vaccine once a decade because I'm not that kind of retarded. If someone offers you free drugs, you take them and say thank you, because drugs are expensive. Overall Latvian health care system is nonexistent, it is preferred that citizens fuck off and die in the woods.

It was a freezing cold, Sunday morning that started with my grandmother shouting from the 1st floor: "House is on fire!". In the basement floor there was a burning set of car tires that made a lot of dramatic looking dark smoke, there was also a full 50 liter propane tank that, sadly, didn't get to blow up. My mother called the fire department and instructed me to go to my great-aunt's apartment. My mother, who had a mobile phone, a rare luxury for the time and place I might add, didn't bother to call my great-aunt to inform her of the situation, even as I was walking to her apartment. I remember my slippers filling with snow that would almost instantly melt, soaking my feet, freezing my fingers until I couldn't feel them anymore. Thankfully my great-aunt was home and she let me in. I think this was the first time I learned that my mother doesn't truly give a shit about my life or wellbeing, my mother spent all her time and resources to preserve her precious house, giving zero fucks where I am and how am I. Now my great-aunt was a piece of work too, after couple of hours of hospitality, she informed me that she has to go to the church now: "Up you go now, go home child.", she said to me. This is Catholicism in its disgusting essence, to earn a spot in the heavenly afterlife, going to church, leaving your material belongings to organized pedophile ring a.k.a. Vatican City Inc., throwing a terrified and crying child outside in a freezing cold while he is wearing wet slippers so that you can visit church on God's Sunday, that is the only ultimate way to Christian paradise. When I came home, all freezing and still shaken, my mother was fucking pissed that I came back so early, she would question my ability to follow her instructions, all the while she herself couldn't find a few minutes to literally walk over to my great-aunts apartment to check on me or at least call from her, at the time, fancy ass Nokia 6110 mobile phone. As an adult, I despise the idea that church is somehow privileged to be exempt from paying income tax. If for example, some degenerate gambler Catholic fucktard leaves all of his or her material belongings to Catholic church in a worthless attempt to secure their place in heaven, the Catholic church should be taxed with the same aggression as gambling. I remember that during primary school there was an obligatory religious teaching class, entire premise of this class was some dipshit Catholic priest lying to a bunch of kids, promising, if they behave like good little sheeple and do a good job in class without causing any trouble, they will GO ON AN EXCITING BOAT RIDE! Plot twist, there was no boat, there was nothing in the end but empty promises. As a kid, I was really pumped up about that "boat ride". I think this was the first and last time I was ecstatic about opportunity to travel somewhere. To this day I have not traveled outside Latvia, I have barely traveled outside my home town, I barely get a chance to slip out of my mother's house without being harassed, questioned and demanded to explain myself.
</p><p>
My father lost most of his credibility in my eyes after I witnessed him meeting his "business partner", who would be selling my father's stolen goods and kicking him back some of the profits. For some context, my father gave his business "buddy" stolen, brand new, hi-fi car audio equipment that his partner in crime sold, buuut things happened and the money was gone and that's that. I suppose my father brought me with him and informed me to stay in the car as an insurance, so the other scumbag wouldn't become physically aggressive in front of a minor. My piece of shit father would use his worthless words, empty threats, but the other scumbag would laugh about his antics and ridiculous demands, my father, gaining absolutely nothing would proceed to jump in his shitty Audi achtzig, pedal to the metal, gravel hitting the rusted underside of the car while driving away and that is all I can recall from that incident.
</p><p>
For some weird reason, during my childhood and even most of my teen years, I was taught and seriously believed, or should I say, I was fearmongered into believing that all homosexual men and also women who allow themselves to be fucked in the ass, before reaching their 40's, sometimes as early as their 30's or even 20's, are all without an exception, disgusting, colostomy bag or permanently prolapsed anus, adult diapers wearing, pant shitting degenerates. All this overexaggerated bullshit from family and even friends actually pushed me to do my own research and realize how shallow minded and dangerously brainwashed majority of the Catholic degenerates and their offspring are. I come from a small community where a woman becomes publicly known as a dirty, disease ridden village whore simply because a word got out that she has an intrauterine contraceptive device inserted in her uterus.
</p><p>
It took me, without grasping the gravity of what the fuck I was doing, showing my fully erect child's penis to my father, before my mother would establish a rule that no one will ever walk in the bathroom when I'm naked, I should always lock the door, it's a private thing from now on forward. In my own mind I was ecstatic that I finally, for the first time will be allowed to bathe without someone watching or harassing me. The really fucked up thing was that instead of explaining any basic concepts of human sexuality, my mother interrogated me: "How did you do that?". She played this fake curiosity and seriously asked me how I was able to give myself an erection, it felt as if I had done something that has never been done before and there was something incredibly wrong with me physically. My mother has a thing to overreact with overplayed enthusiasm even over the dumbest shit I do, calling me a genius over the simplest of achievements, anything that comes out of that mentally ill woman's mouth is meaningless, manipulative bullshit. Anyway, the entire ordeal left me believing that whatever I did was incredibly wrong, unnatural and sickening to witness for others. I suppose it's a very Catholic thing to be ashamed of anything related to human sexuality. I remember for a very long time having my pullout couch placed in a completely open, walk through room, I was touching my dick under my blanket without fully understanding what I was doing, but there was a lot of precum that terrified me because it didn't have the consistency of urine, even though it kind of looked like I was pissing myself a little, and my parents would nonchalantly walk by me, either not realizing what was happening or more likely trying to catch a glimpse of me touching myself. For the longest time I thought I'm sick or broken, but was too ashamed to ask for help. My parents never bothered to give me the birds and the bees talk, they just asked me if i knew anything, I explained that I was taught some things in school, so it was good enough, in reality, in my juvenile mind, I had created so many, so very wrong misconceptions that would haunt me for years. It's so shameful to admit, but when my foreskin was detaching from the head of my penis, I thought I broke my dick and it might be god punishing me for touching myself, I didn't have a father to ask for advice, instead, I always had a dad, who would only become touchy-feely when drunk, so I asked for advice from my classmate, who was being raised by a single mother, the classmate explained to me that it is a completely normal part of reaching puberty and I can probably gently detach that skin in a single attempt, which I successfully did, as I was sick and tired of the regular, small tears that would occur naturally and be followed by a lot of bleeding. My mother did teach me that I should be incredibly thankful for being born a male as it was only girls who would bleed from down there, so bleeding after wanking or even simply washing my dick for many months was this ridiculously scary and shameful experience for me.
</p><p>
I will never forget the very progressive and new thing that was introduced to school kids during my time in middle school, a child psychologist. This morbidly obese representation of psychology as a pseudo-science it is, openly made fun about my weight and eating habits in front of my classmates, they laughed, her making that shitty joke at the expense of my body image gave me very strong predisposition against overweight people and psychologists in general. I realize that particular woman had some serious mental issues of her own and overeating was the only comfort she could find without medicating. This child psychologist was also the one given the very overdue task to explain puberty and related issues to a bunch of pubescent teens, I think the part of how to put a condom on a cucumber was shown to the entire class, however, when it came time to talk about women's sexual physiology and health, the psychologist instructed all the boys to leave the classroom, a lot of very important things were only explained to girls, things I shamefully learned on my own only in my twenties, simply because one day I was unemployed, drunk and bored, so I stared researching the topic and felt incredibly ashamed of how shallow minded and stupid I had been for two fucking decades, not to mention discovering some of the more taboo topics that are discomforting to discuss openly because of their graphic and/or emotionally traumatic nature.
</p><p>
My parents have always been extremely intrusive in my personal life, I remember my mother being lowkey disappointed in my taste of women, she tried really hard to brain-wash me into believing that choice of a partner should first and foremost be based on superficial things like pretty face, light skin color, petite body, hard-working, having an above average sized camel toe or some other hillbilly soviet fertility test, skinny legs that don't look like sausages, having or dying hair in a dark color, preferably coming from a wealthy family background and so on. It almost felt like I was conditioned to find myself a woman that would appeal to the sexual and material preferences of both of my parents.
</p><p>
The last time I gained trust of someone to kiss on the lips was when me with some classmates decided to play "spin the bottle". I liked this one girl so much I thought I will try replicating the disgusting behavior of my father on her, so I went straight for a tongue kiss, which ended in less than a second, other classmates also felt it was not ok, game was over because I had to take it too far by attempting to do tongue stuff. Disgusted reaction from that girl didn't really sink in for me until years later, now I see it as a turning point where I stopped being the victim and became the abuser. I wouldn't be surprised I traumatized that poor girl by giving her one of the worst somewhat sexual experiences at that age.
</p><p>
In my teen years, I got really upset when I wasn't allowed in my own room, because my father was using the only family computer to introduce my mother and my grandparents to the western sickness that is homosexuality, he did it by pirating and showing them gay porn, where paid actors, not necessarily with untraditional sexual orientation simply because of the money, fueled with chemically induced erections, ramming pre-stretched and pre-lubed rectums for what might be one trick followed by a week of rehabilitation. I was too naive and stupid to grasp the real issue at hand, instead, I was angry that my room wasn't really mine after all. I had nothing to do, I had no friends to go to, I was stuck going insane from boredom while my parents and grandparents where watching hard core gay porn in "my" room, god I'm so ungrateful and entitled. The really fucked up part was the slight hesitation from my parents if I should be present at this educational moment of incestuous family hardcore gay porn screening time. All I have ever wanted since my teen years was a proper grown up job to support myself and escape this incestual, rural, multigenerational nightmare.
</p><p>
My parents don't believe in corporal punishments, instead, they use guilt tripping and fearmongering as manipulation tools, and it has permanently crippled me mentally. Guilt tripping theme has always been very strong in my upbringing, I will take to my grave this eternal debt, feel of shame and guilt about the fact, that I should be eternally thankful to my mother, that she didn't abort me like she did with the first pregnancy and the guilty conscience for the scars I gave her during childbirth that ultimately ruined any leftover chances for her to attract a decent partner. As if her mental issues would attract anyone decent.
</p><p>
During my teen years, I very clearly recall reaching out to my mother in hopes that she could help me find a job, instead of help she asked: "Why do you need a job?", to which I replied: "To have my own money so I can buy things.", but instead of helping me, my mother explained that I am not allowed to seek employment, if I need anything, I can just ask. I quickly learned that asking for things would become this process where my parents would try to convince me that whatever I'm asking for isn't needed, that I won't use it or that we currently can't afford such bullshit items, and even if they agreed, it would most likely be this shameful experience of them taking me to the store and me weirdly following them around while the adult does the shopping and paying. When my grandfather got his ring finger swollen, he cut off his golden wedding ring basically ruining it, repairing it would cost more than its market value as a metal and the ring didn't have any sentimental value to anyone, so he gifted those ring remains to me. At the time gold wasn't worth that much, eventually I traded that ring for a used Tamagotchi toy that I was too ashamed to ask for to my parents, especially knowing my father's deep hatred towards Japanese cartoons or something, also, at the time, I either wasn't familiar with the concept or was too terrified to travel to the city using public transportation on my own. Time went by and the price of gold doubled or even quadrupled and suddenly my parents found this cool thing, they could gather all of the family gold items and trade them in to get store credit at jewelry store to buy some shitty silver earrings for my mother. This was the moment my father remembered the ring my grandfather gifted to me, to this day my piece of shit father regularly keeps bringing up the question: "Where did that ring go?", now he suddenly fucking needs it for himself to trade in for some shitty silver jewelry. Of course I'm ashamed to admit to that piece of shit one of my earliest lessons about being scared, stupid, brainwashed kid who didn't know how to buy a bus ticket, not to mention the hard lesson about investment metals and trade market in general, as it will bring out even more guilt tripping and shaming from my piece of shit dad. Hell, even when I finally got a job that allowed me to accumulate a few hundred euros in savings, this one time I borrowed my dad's Mercedes B class to flex on my coworkers in their 30's and 40's who would get obviously jelous of some 27 year old kid driving a ridiculously "luxurious" 13 year old vehicle with market value of "whopping" 5 thousand euros in the year of 2018. I suppose such is Latvian peasant mentality. After returning home, I noticed and pointed out to my father a small crack in the small plastic turn signal cover in one of the wing mirror housings, naturally, my dad quickly jumped to nagging, blaming and guilt tripping me for the defect, being in doubt, and for the first time in my life not being totally broke, I offered to replace/fix it two or three times before it became a non-issue and he finally shut the fuck up and wouldn't bring it up ever again. My parents value their social status symbol car and other precious material belongings above human wellbeing, and for that, I simply can't stand dealing with those toxic pieces of shit in my everyday life.
</p><p>
When my dad had his middle age crisis or something, he might have been fornicating with some whores from his workplace, in his defense, in a traditional Russian upbringing: hole is hole, wife is nothing more than indentured servant for the duration of marriage. What got under my skin was my mother complaining to me, that while this piece of shit cheats on her, she still has to wash his jizz stained underwear and pretend that everything is just fine. This for me was a wakeup call, first and foremost to start doing my own laundry, which in my mother's household literally consists of adding washing detergent, fabric softener in the washing machine, turning a knob and pushing a button. It didn't sit very well with my mother as she had spent most of her life cultivating this "culture" of artificial dependency. I despise women who are like mother - stupid, obedient whores, doing demenial chores for their dysfunctional degenerate husbands. I think it was very fucked up that my mother didn't at least give me a heads up that she is not only visually inspecting and touching, but possibly even sniffing my precum soaked underwear. Instead, she always kept singing this bullshit line: "When will you find yourself a wife so she does XYZ for you instead of me." What kind of demented piece of shit mother conditions her son to grow up to be useless, dysfunctional, worthless, abusive degenerate, all like his father, or maybe she was expecting that in this day and age it is still possible to find some mentally crippled girl, who will become the next indentured servant, lifting some of the household work off of my mother's shoulders. I'm so fucking sick and tired of being regularly greeted with my father's semen and shit stained underwear and other dirty clothing items laying on the bathroom and toilet floor, sometimes literally for a week before my mother picks it all up and puts it in the washing machine. Living with any stereotypical Russian male is life with an abusive, dysfunctional piece of shit degenerate swine, no normal human being can be raised in traditional post-soviet Russian family like mine.
</p><p>
My father has this disgusting habit of picking his nose and smearing his boogers under chairs, tables, behind bedframes, basically anywhere he can reach and isn't obviously visible. As a kid, I quickly picked up the habit from my father. As the years went by this habit started to seriously affect my social life in a negative way. It took me months, possibly years to mostly kick the habit, still, I often catch myself starting to pick my nose, realize it, stop, pick up a tissue and resolve the discomfort in my nose quickly and in a more civilized manner. After my father gifted me 32" SDTV with incredibly washed out colors, for many, many years he would come to my room and demand that I either do my school homework or I quickly pirate a movie that would appeal to his liking. That piece of shit consumes TV and movies only if they are voice over dubbed in Russian, I once suggested him to read subtitles and he straight up became aggressive and started to heighten his voice and scold me. Procrastinator and scared child in me almost always would agree to entertain my degenerate father as long as I wouldn't have to do any school work then and there, every fucking day my unemployed father would spend hours in my room, when he finally got exhausted from Russian movie and TV time and went away to sleep or eat, I would stay up late, finally doing my homework while in the background I would sometimes watch the same movie my father just watched, but already knowing all the major plot twists, mostly enjoying the fact that English speaking actors have unique voices, finally understanding the jokes and most other things that got lost in cheap translation and finally being able to hear why people who worked on the music and sound got an Oscar or some other gay nomination for that particular movie. This routine would leave me constantly sleep deprived, losing appetite, having issues to perform at my best academically and losing any chances to secure any decent state sponsored scholarship. Anyway, one time when my dad was sitting in my room watching telly I called him out for smearing his boogers under my furniture, so my piece of shit dad became hyper aggressive, denied it and he stated that I did it myself, then he asserted his dominance by proceeding to smear another fat booger on the furniture and grin like the Russian degenerate piece of shit he is. Fucking wow, father of the fucking year! It was him who normalized the disgusting habit for me in the first place, it took me so much time and effort to kick it and now this this piece of shit is smearing boogers under my chair and desk, behind my bedframe and blames me for it. When other teens of my age at the time were socializing and having unprotected sex, I was too busy cleaning my dad's boogers from furniture in "my" room. After his cancer treatment 20 years ago my father became this permanent, unemployed fixture around the household, bored piece of shit sociopath controlling and ruining life for everyone in his vicinity.
</p><p>
When I was turning 18, my mother sponsored my driving school. Acquiring driver's license in Latvia, at least from my perspective, is a rather expensive and luxurious privilege even for an average adult, not to mention unemployed high schooler. My father seemed very unsupportive, at times even aggressive, especially when I went and acquired learners permit, for that he of course became hyper aggressive, started scolding me, I had to find and read the fucking law to that Russian degenerate to explain that in ex-soviet Latvia we do have things called laws and the learners permit is an actual requirement. For many years my father was the only one in the family who owned a car and the only one who could drive it, I suppose he gets fucking hard from the idea that family members have to beg him to be driven somewhere and then he can act like the diva he is, being all grumpy and unsatisfied. Car ownership and related financial issues is a major breaking point in almost any Russian family, the 10 year old luxury class vehicle that still has fresh German-Turkish farts in its seats does serve as a symbol of a superior social status, but ultimately ends up being expensive toy to maintain and the source of ultimate misery that breaks apart families financially.
</p><p>
This one time my father stole pliers or some other shitty tool from his workplace, so he "gifts" this tool to me and says it's now mine. In his fucked up scheme, this now serves as yet another reason to barge in my room without knocking or loudly bang on my door, demanding it to be opened THIS FUCKING INSTANCE and be given the tool he stole from his workplace. "Gifting" me a tool also gave him a valid reason to go through my stuff, when caught, he could bullshit me that he was looking for his tools. When he finds something he shouldn't have, my mother would make distasteful, embarrassing comments, playing her mind games by dropping shitty contextual or keyword cues, I suppose as if to force me to give guilty confessions about the skeletons they found in my closet or drawer. I can't even properly budget because I need to burn my receipts so that my parents can't find them and use them as yet another guilt tripping, manipulation tool. I can't receive mail without it being possibly opened by my father, my parents always harass me to show and explain contents of any correspondence I receive. There always is this sickening, intimate presence of my owners, they share their filth with me, they want me to be completely open and honest to them, and keep my mouth shut about family business to outsiders.
</p><p>
Out of sheer desperation I started to sit down like a bitch when peeing, I still got blamed for pissing on the rim, no matter how low I bend I still get blamed for doing something wrong in my mother's household.
</p><p>
When I was 21 I could not exchange phone numbers to keep in touch with people, even though I had two working mobile phones. One phone was provided to me by my father and he had full access to my call and messaging history because the SIM card was registered in his name, it was easier to never use that phone than explain who and why was I calling and how come it is so expensive, on the other hand I had the cheapest button phone, provided to me by my employer, who also had full access to my call and messaging history. Biggest trouble I ever got in a work related situation was when I left my work phone charging, on my work desk, after my work hours had ended. I had a very unpleasant talk about subordination as I was required to keep my work phone on me 24/7, answer calls immediately with no excuses, also my employers found it offensive that I didn't use my work phone for personal communication. At the time I was making minimum wage of 140 lats a month minus 20 lats for bus fare, being forced to take work phone home with me was considered a fat bonus. I found it very peculiar that the mobile service provider allowed my employer to access all the call, texting and private sexting history done with company phones, but it would not show up on the monthly bill because this service was provided free of charge as a special bonus for a corporate client. Oh, and my employer also had a pirated copy of Ardamax keylogger preinstalled on my work computer, on my first day on the job I was demanded to log in my personal email account to receive some files or whatever, but it was done with the intention to expose my password so that my employer could use it to snoop around my digital life.
</p><p>
For a few years my mother owned this one dog that developed some serious health issues very early in its life, either in its lungs or it started in throat and traveled in to the lungs with time, the dog was sick and obviously suffering. My mom didn't have the money to bring that dog to a vet and she was too much of a mother Teresa to euthanize that dog, believing, that suffering is part of god's plan or something. Because I was unemployed, during that time my complaints were mostly ignored, as a freeloader I didn't deserve to have a calm and quiet place to rest and sleep. For absurdly long time, I spent countless nights hearing trough my cardboard bedroom door as that dog would cough to a point it would start vomiting, as the coughing fit would come to an end the dog would lick up the already cold vomit, which in turn would irritate its throat and the coughing fit would start all over again, and it would vomit yet again, I spent sleepless hours listening as that dog would cough, vomit, slurp its vomit and repeat that viscous cycle for multiple hours a night, for fucking months and years. I fucking hate people who take up responsibility for animals they have zero intention to take proper care of or at least euthanize them when the animal becomes a nuisance they can't afford to fix.
</p><p>
My father always has had a thing for establishing his status as the alpha male of the house. Currently, it all starts with the incredibly loud noise from the spring loaded mechanism in his recliner chair, that nightmarish sound is so loud it echoes through the entire house, then he proceeds with his manly walk, stomping his elephant feet, doing his soviet army parade walk, when he passes my door there is a probability that he might either bang with his fist, scratch his nails on the cardboard or glass panes of my bedroom door, push down the door handle and let it spring back in its original position with incredibly loud bang, that shit has given me straight up heart attacks and woken me up from REM sleep cycle countless times. Even my mother started terrorizing me with this shit.
</p><p>
My mother demanded priority access to the only bathroom in the house. I was forced into a compromise by my mother, If I wanted to use the bathroom to shower and attempt to do a proper, clean shave, I had to wake up around 5AM, but once I was done, especially if I was skipping breakfast and the car didn't require 10-15 minutes to remove ice and snow, I often was left with at least 30 minutes, sometimes almost an hour, to read news or spend it on some guilty pleasure like watching a few episodes of UNHhhh, but most of the time I would attempt a power nap by just laying on my bed in underwear, my phone laying on top of my chest with an alarm clock set to give me enough time to dress, tie a tie and drive to work safely with time to spare. Every fucking morning my mother would proceed to get dressed right outside my bedroom, making incredible amount of noise for what felt like fucking eternity and before leaving, that stupid piece of shit cunt would bang on the cardboard door or the transparent glass panes of my bedroom door, effectively waking me up, countless times denying me even a lousy 30 minute nap before 40+ minute drive to a dead end job where I was barely scraping together 300 euros a month after travel expenses and even after adjusting it for the income tax overpayment. When I would return home from that dead end job I was denied to use the same bathroom from 7PM to 12PM because otherwise my piece of shit father would use that as an excuse why he couldn't take an hour long bathing session, and my mother would blame and guilt trip me for that, I don't understand how she can share a bed with that filthy, unwashed swine.

I've had multiple bosses who would use the phrase: "Get creative!", instead of blatantly encouraging doing a tax fraud. My entire life consists of couple minutes, couple hours, maybe half a day of freedom once a year when I am not supervised by my family members, not enough time to pursue relationships, personal or professional, but enough to get creative. Ever since I discovered that male prostate is fingers deep, things have developed from there. It was one of those rare, once a year occasion when I was left unattended, I had wasted the entire morning sugar waxing my legs and ass, and evacuating turds from my sigmoid colon. It's an entire thing that I can break down as an accountant:
</div><div class="teksts22">
<ul class="mypersonalitytype"><li>
5 inch heels and garter belt from amazon.de - 18€</li><li>
White Fiore stockings with white back seam from beli.pl - 3€</li><li>
Body safe silicone toy from Fun Factory - 45€</li><li>
Making eye contact through the glass door pane with my mother while a pink dildo is poking its head in my sigmoid colon - fucking priceless.</li></ul></div><div class="teksts2">
Because I am living with controlling parents and grandparents that have denied me any privacy or ability to pursue relationships, for me this is the only way to at least partially experience things that no normal women will ever do for me, you know, wax legs and ass, wear makeup and pretty clothing, and have sexual intercourse while my mother is dragging her nails on window panes of my bedroom door or sitting arms reach distance away from my bedframe outside the window. When my eyes met with my mother through the glass panes of my bedroom door, I was sitting with ass on a small table, with dildo up my ass, half-mast and a trail of my own semen in front of me, in that moment all I could feel was pure hatred. Normally my mother ends her working day at 4PM, but this day she was allowed to go home 15 minutes early so she could catch me in action. As I was cleaning semen from the floor and lube from the table my mother proceeded to play her dollhouse fantasy by obnoxiously loudly banging spoon against the tea cup, outside my window, an arm's reach distance away from my bed. It might have been the same day I asked for permission to replace my own bedroom door and got an answer: "No.". That was the moment I realized the fucking cunt must enjoy watching and listening how I masturbate. I can't have conversations in my room, my grandmother asks me: "I heard you laugh in your room, what were you laughing about?", same can be expected from my parents: "I heard you had a call, who were you talking to?". It also works the other way around, being forced to listen how my grandmother and mother talk shit about relatives and that disgusting hyena laughter, this fucking nightmare hellhole house. I don't mind strangers who spy and listen in, that's their own issues they have to work through, but having my parents and grandparents breathing down my neck 24/7 for more than 29 years has permanently fucked up any chance for me to have a healthy social life. I mean how do I explain to a woman that if she dares to enter "my" household she must expect to be groped, pinched and sexually assaulted by my dad and I will do absolutely nothing about it because it is haram to hit or school your own father.
</p><p>
I keep falling for the same fate of getting hired by a male business owner or a man in a lead position who needs someone to fill their tax reports on time and within the requirements of the law. It takes me about 2 to 3 months to learn most of the work specifics that come with a new place of employment and suddenly office becomes too small, I start stepping on toes because as I become more efficient and precise I openly admit that I would rather do something productive instead of pretending to work or adjusting my work speed to a snail's pace. My direct superior always ends up being some mentally disturbed woman with broken marriage, this woman uses her position to humiliate and destroy me because I represent the male patriarchy or whatever this mentally ill, single mother with fucked up life and fucked up children sees in me. Women in upper management and those who own their own business have openly questioned me, as to why do I feel that as a male I deserve to work a white collar job, that the way I talk Russian is unacceptable and I should never ever attempt to do it again if I don't have the necessary language skills, it's nothing more than ridiculous, sexist discrimination and gaslighting. Whenever I bring this up to anyone I'm being laughed at. When I, as a young male, admit being discriminated by a woman barely decade older than me, however, that woman is in a position of power to hire, lay off, deny promotion etc., it is funny as all hell to everyone and only proves that I am a worthless retard. I suppose a male in his late twenties with a face of a 13-year-old and coming from abusive and controlling family background is an easy target for further abuse and deserves to be a social outcast and laughing stock.

In 2018 I was hired as a junior accountant, even though I have been around and in the field of accounting for more than a decade and I have a professional Bachelors degree in Accounting, Finance and Audit from University of Latvia, go figure. At the time it felt like a lucky break for me, as I was promised professionally fulfilling work, stable and guaranteed job for many years to come with prospects of growth and a steady incremental pay rise without the need to beg for it, which all turned out to be empty promises and blatant lies. The company that hired me was one of the factories of this international giant specializing in production of optical fibers, medical probes and accompanying laser devices. I wish I could call them out by their names, but I have been threatened with professional defamation by their CFO and received retaliation threats from their HR representative. In most other situations I wouldn't bat an eye on questionable business practices of my employer, but the fact that these subhuman Russian only speaking degenerates manufacture medical equipment is alarming. First red flag I noticed at this company was the work safety instruction, or rather lack of any instructions on proper safety procedures, only some medically inaccurate two minute instruction on how to relieve eye strain was provided to me in Russian only, I believe the worker responsible for the work safety didn't speak any Latvian, I think the degenerate piece of shit was also the one openly spreading bullshit about Bates method being effective "cure" for myopia and hyperopia. He might have been one of the many friends and family members hired by the Russian goons to pump out more free money from stupid Germans who wouldn't get their hands dirty by physically overseeing work and being present in their own Eastern European factory. There is this idea that because doctors in 3rd world countries use thermal sterilization and reuse the single use probes for multiple times, supposedly the probes were made to become more brittle, easily break apart after going trough thermal stress, I want to believe it's bullshit, no manufacturer wants to harm and scare away clients on purpose. In reality there definitely was an issue with expired glue or some shit, penny pinching Russian goons in upper management time after time would deny any requests to buy new materials or resources as to earn bigger bonuses for expanding profit margins, the expired glue, epoxy or whatever it is called didn't cure as it should, I think I heard that the defective probes where leeching toxins from the uncured glue and even started to break apart inside some western European patient bodies, very bad, potential lawsuit would require to ditch one throwaway company and make another identical one and yet again re-hire or find different Russian goons. Latvia doesn't have lowest taxes or most qualified workers in Europe, but we have an abundance of relatively cheap Russians that don't give a fuck about laws and languages used in the European Union, they will create meaningless paperwork and take the fall by taking the full responsibility for the fraud and wrong doings in exchange for money and at the signs of a potential criminal liability they will fuck off to Russia and be untouchable. I was asked to leave the company some two days after I had the audacity to ask for a pay rise that I was promised. I think my biggest mistake was using the argument that everyone else got one, so why am I being left out and discriminated? As some part of humiliation, my work desk that was bought specifically for me, on purpose, it was uncomfortably small desk with insufficient leg room, I think it might have been a desk designed for a midget or a small school child, definitely not for an adult male that would be expected to be cramped in it for 8+ hours every day. My legs would constantly cramp up, so I was offered a foot stool, as a sarcastic joke I guess. The worst thing was having my workplace located few centimeters away from this Polish-Russian, morbidly obese, speaking only distorted version of Russian and incomprehensible Latvian, an actual real life fetal alcohol syndrome looking subhuman who literally couldn't be bothered to wash her sweaty, fishy cunt. This woman had visual oversight of my keyboard and monitors, my company accounts and passwords were all compromised from day one, employing this woman for the company cost 15 000 euros per year, her main function at the company was to drink coffee, open the window and turn on the AC at the same time, trash talk about co-workers, shout vulgar profanities and of course spend most of her workday spying on me and reporting back to the management about my performance, she herself informed me that she deeply regrets advising the management to hire me, management of course denied these claims. This woman was very openly proud of 3 things in her life: 1st giving birth before finishing high school, 2nd being a home and land owner, and 3rd driving a 10 year old BMW 5-series. This worker bee took the precious time out of her busy work schedule to openly shame me and express to me her deep disgust with my inability to procreate and have the financial stability to support a family, in her opinion, I was a wasted generation. I understand that I took this way too personally because of my fragile male ego, but that lard ass cunt was mostly right. Even total shitbag like her had managed to do everything I have on my bucket list by the age of 30, you know, have job title that you are not ashamed to talk about, plant a tree, have a kid or two, buy a house, pretty basic daydreaming fantasies of mine. These days I mostly fantasize about being able to escape my incestual Russian family horror house and rent a small apartment that would include access to running water, flushable toilet and a working washing machine. I also dream of owning an iron and a decent clothes airer because I can't seem to get away from the smell, you know the smell of a very old cotton that has never been fully dried, I'm afraid that while I can smell the mold on my clothing only a little others can smell it a lot.
</p><p>
My father has very strong opinions, he won't go out of his way to deny LGBTQ degenerates to do whatever they want to do in their own private property, he is okay with all that sodomy as long it's not happening in the public or under his roof. Fucking hypocrite, I had a brief moment when I felt like I might have a gender dysphoria, then I read some message board posts from people who actually have it and realized I simply hate my body. My father has a thing for leaving bathroom door open when he takes an hour long bath, so when I am forced to see my father's disgusting naked body, half the source of my tiny Russian feet and penis, I hate that piece of shit so much, mostly because I know that balding, disgusting manlet is my own mirror image in couple of decades. I am terrified to become like my father: fat, disgusting, balding, Russian, rapist, faggot piece of shit, except shorter because I got some of the midget genes from my mother's side.
</p><p>
Household where I live is always under some kind of eternal, never ending home improvements. My unemployed father renovates a room in the house for months and even years, it depends on how slow or fast my mother can earn enough money and resources, it all always starts with my unemployed father spending the first half of the day getting fucked up on alcohol, the other half of the day my drunken piece of shit father spends ruining whatever materials he is using, at the end of the day my mother is shouting at my piece shit dad for wasted money on ruined wallpaper, tiles or whatever, my father shouts back that the walls are crooked and the poorly built house is the real issue and the woman needs to shut the fuck up or do it better herself. Rinse and repeat this shit for months and decades. My father is always the smartest man in the room, he will loudly and openly laugh and comment your child's pathetic skills at some school related performance while his own child quietly sits in the corner like a talentless, incestual faggot bitch should.
</p><p>
I didn't have normal parental guidance during my youth, my mind and worldview has mostly been shaped by other degenerates from message boards alike Два.ч and 4chan. I believe I learned to tie my shoes properly only in my late teen years from a random stranger shitposting on 4chan. My life values can be encapsulated in short mantras like: "Don't stick your dick in a crazy.", and if you couldn't follow that simple piece of advice and shit hits the fan: "Lawyer up, delete Facebook, hit the gym.". The only thing these internet strangers can't seem to provide is the knowledge on how to legally obtain enough money to even afford a lawyer or dating to begin with. I suppose youth is wasted on the young, I robbed my parents of their 20s by being born, so they robbed me of my youth and they have no intention to ever let me be independent adult. Most of my life I've been trapped in the middle of fucking nowhere in some rural Latvian shithole in the middle of some woods, I know how to respect my Russian authority, I know how to keep my mouth shut and my head low, I don't feel safe, I have never felt safe living with my incestual degenerate Russian family, I don't want to be touched and monitored 24/7 by my controlling, unemployed owners anymore. I don't really mind workers at my ISP being able to investigate my internet traffic, I find the idea of anyone doxxing me weird because I am a nobody, but I don't want to be sharing accounts and passwords with my parents.
</p><p>
My owners keep sharing with me their demented filth and expect for me to do the same in return, to be completely open and transparent with everything. My father becomes hyper aggressive when I'm too ashamed to admit how little money I make, which means I'm secretly hiding money from the family. My parents straight up have had the talk with me on multiple occasions, explaining to me that they are my best friends, that I should not see them as parents but as roommates. I'm not allowed to live my own life, my function is to entertain my owners and forcefully be their best friend for life. I don't know where to go or ask for help.
</p><p>
I hate my mother for constantly forcing on me her opinion that I somehow have a talent for languages, that it supposedly comes so easy for me. I learned some Russian out of the pure spite that my family would speak it so that I, as a kid, could not understand the disgusting things they would trash talk about relatives or "friends" of family. My entire childhood TV box was almost always screaming tampon and other personal hygiene product commercials in Russian, which for me was the main source to learn the language. No one was teaching me Russian properly, I had to backwards engineer the meaning of words, I would learn a few words, I would hear them in sentences, I would try making sense of those sentences by context. It was nightmarish, slow process that has left me with knowledge of a distorted version of Russian. I sometimes pronounce some words like a Ukrainian, it's not a political statement or a subliminal message, it's just the way I talk because I sourced my vocabulary and accents from weird and wrong sources, but some "cultured" Russian speaking people find it offensive because Crimeariver. I perfected my English by trying to isolate myself from my nightmarish, controlling family. I have spent more than a decade pirating terabytes of western movies, tv and music. Initially I was telling myself I'm doing this to get the hang on accents, learn new words and so on. Nowadays, I am binge watching shows like Atlanta to escape my own reality, I kept rewatching that Teodor Perkins episode in hopes to recapture the same experience I got when watching it for the first time ever, I never did, but the show is rewarding by revealing more layers and hidden gems when rewatched, it keeps me busy and distracted from my own reality. My favorite movie for the last decade has been The Graduate, mostly because of Anne Bancroft, but it also is the only movie that sends me through full emotional spectrum of cringe, laughter, existential crisis and depression in less than 2 hours. My favorite movie starring Anne Bancroft is The Miracle Worker, but my favourite song by Simon & Garfunkel is Mrs. Robinson.
</p><p>
Most of my hobbies and things that I truly enjoy can all be regarded as some type of mechanism for me to escape reality. During my teen years operating system on my computer's hard drive wouldn't last even a month before I formatted that drive and started from scratch. It basically became this paranoid and obsessive process of installing different "flavor" of OS, encrypting the partition, setting up and configuring software, but I would always be paranoid about some piece of pirated software or my own stupidity creating a backdoor for uninvited guests, then again, blindly trusting any closed source software by default is a gaping backdoor for your IT system security. Ever since Windows 7 became unsupported I've been postponing switching to Debian, I quietly blame my old hardware not having proper Linux drivers, but in all honesty I'm simply lazy sack of shit that can't shake off old habits and it will come around biting me in the ass sooner or later.
</p><p>
During one of my earliest work experiences I got very lucky to mingle and talk with this one journalist, I will be eternally thankful to her that she took the time to introduce me to the core principles of journalism and how to approach fact checking. Before that, I was one of those people who only read headlines from my favorite yellow press tier "news" sources that also had the most interesting and shocking click-bait. These days I mostly try to avoid reading and watching news because it takes ridiculous amount of time to research and fact check an article, often only to be given varying points of view and still having to side on the subject matter based on my own gut feeling. I do value some news outlets as more trustworthy than others and prefer sticking to them. Internet gives us access to almost unlimited amount of information that, for the most part, is worthless bullshit.
</p><p>
I have always found it weird how absurd amount of people working in the field of finance and accounting are extremely secretive and hostile when it comes to sharing basic professional knowledge. On the other hand, even underpaid electrical engineer can find a few minutes to explain to someone like me how an oscilloscope works, now I have learned that it isn't a fancy multimeter, while oscilloscope only measures voltage and plots a 2D graph of voltage changing in time, in the hands of an electrical engineer or even hobbyist this tool makes designing and troubleshooting an electrical circuit quick and easy. I have not met a single chief accountant or financial officer that would share their professional knowledge for free and in such simple, constructive and informative manner. Same engineer even showed me how cheap Raspberry Pi unit and preferably some basic knowledge in scripting can replace a specialty device with proprietary everything costing thousands of euros, some Eastern Europeans have a talent to gain fantastic results with limited resources and lots of ingenuity.
</p><p>
Some months ago I was hugging one of my dad's precious kitchen appliances for too long, so naturally, he comes at me and starts painfully pinching and groping me in my stomach, I grabbed both of his hands below his palms and that piece of shit started to resist, I grabbed a chair and pulled it between myself and my father and quickly went to my room and locked myself in. For the rest of the evening my father kept having drinks, playing very loud music, loudly going to the toilet and pissing like a racehorse, either banging on my door or mashing the door handle and laughing with his wife for about 5 hours before finally going to bed around midnight. I, a 28 year old male, spent those 5 hours sobbing because I'm incapable to reach financial independence to run away and to rent my own living space and cover basic needs, I'm dependant and can't break the cycle. My degenerate parents even straight up demanded that I apply to a job 2 minutes away from their workplace, so they can keep me on a short leash during work time and ride me up my ass after work and during weekends. Simply being forced to listen and hear my father's disgusting voice makes me want to beat that scumbag with my bare fists till he stops moving and breathing, so that he can never ever again lay a finger on me. When I tried confronting my mother about the whole ordeal by shamefully admitting: "A woman hasn't touched me in my lifetime like my dad has.", she replied with: "It was only a JOKE!" and, as per usual, tried to derail the subject to food and eating. For me, this was a Déjà vu moment that opened entire pandora box of suppressed childhood memories, and so this wall of verbal diarrhea was made. For most of my life I couldn't remember anything from my childhood, good or bad, there was just blank emptiness and I wish it remained the same. All I have ever wanted is to find an opportunity or an employer to gain the financial independence to escape from my childhood home and start my own life. For more than a decade I've been terrified to even stop for a minute and be left alone with my thoughts, always forcing myself in some sort of work or activity to keep myself busy and not dwelling in the past, I never wanted to be stuck in my mother's nightmarish incestuous hellhole house of horrors, digging up this suppressed shit from my past memories, but here I am, unemployed degenerate leech, keeping my family's typical male legacy alive.
</p><p>
I've tried to find an escape or some kind of resolution in substance abuse, but, I have painfully realized that it gets exponentially more expensive and taxing on health if used as a permanent crutch. Even the singer Prince OD'ed on fake Vicodin laced with fentanyl, no one is safe or special.
</p><p>
I will never show initiative to pursue a romantic relationship with a woman that is of a noticeably smaller height than me, because to me it feels like latent pedophilia, even if that woman has a face and a passport of someone in her 40's, to me it still feels like taking advantage of a minor. In general, I won't get involved and will try to escape situations where I have to talk to minors. One of my co-workers felt that it was kind of rude to ignore her child, in my defense, I don't feel comfortable speaking to someone else's kid unless introduced by their legal guardian and given at least some kind of verbal approval to speak to their child.
</p><p>
Being less than one year shy from turning 30, I wish I would be worthy enough to at least once experience employment or other source of income that would allow me to rent a safe and calm living space that I wouldn't have to share with a sexual predator, far away from my controlling and manipulative helicopter parenting owners, somewhere, where my parents can never find me.
</p><p>
When I was asked for the first time ever: "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?", I wanted to punch that person in their stupid fucking throat, but instead, I kept smiling and bullshiting my way through the conversation by using a lot of words that didn't lead to any point or conclusion. If I won't die by something dumb like pseudo anonymity fueled road rage accident or cancer treatment, I kind of see myself owning a Bichon Frise named Precious and living that Buffalo Bill fantasy.
</p><p>
The only thing I'm actually grateful in this life is the fact, that I was so fucking isolated and so closely monitored by my family members that I did not have a chance to knock up some easily manipulable or equally mentally twisted girl, on purpose, out of my teenage angst and spite towards my controlling family. When women meet me, initially they might be interested to see what's my defect, when they figure out I'm some kind of a fucked in the head sexual abuse victim and total loser, they are terrified to show me too much affection as I might follow them home like a homeless dog would. Even when telling me simple no, it's so uncomfortable for me to witness a terrified girl/woman carefully cherry picking her words to explain that it's not me but her, or they go straight to the fact that they are the property of their boyfriend and I first need to find this man and make proper transaction, where I either buy this piece of meat or murder the current owner, I don't fully understand how some of the more submissive women are being sold and traded in this man's world, no one is explaining or telling me shit.
</p><p>
It's so weird to be ashamed of a woman who has her shit together, simply because all I want is to be able to seduce and exploit her in to helping me rent out an apartment together and split the bills. On the other hand, women, who are in a predicament of living with abusive or controlling family members of their own, are simply disgusted wasting their time talking to a man like me who is completely broke and worthless.
</p><p>
Lately I've been seriously contemplating the idea to get my hands on one those chemical castration kits to prevent myself from ever having kids and fucking them up mentally even worse than my parents and grandparents have done with me. I am my father's son so I might be an incest loving paedophile like him, only more advanced because of the experience of being on the receiving end so I can learn from the mistakes of my parents. I believe that parenthood should be earned privilege and not a given right.
</p><p>
My family supports my parasitic lifestyle by giving me some money, so I don't starve, sell drugs or go stealing. I spend most of it to keep a 20+ year old, poorly maintained car road legal and in somewhat functional working order, so that I would have reasonable means to pack up my shit and leave. When my father deposits money in my bank account he includes a message in the purpose of the payment like "When will you come out of the closet", I don't understand if he actually finds it humoring or he takes great pride that I, a 29 year old male, in my entire lifetime have been groped in a sexual manner only by 3 men, my father on multiple occasions, and by at least two Russian witchdoctors that my mentally ill mother paid money to do that.
</p><p>
My parents denied me seeking employment in my teen years, now they are fucking clueless as to why I can't convince employers to give me even a lousy minimum wage job now that I'm almost in my 30's. My father sexually humiliates me in the kitchen, every time it happens I want to take one of the knifes and jam it in his degenerate Russian throat, but I'm afraid from my master owner and I don't want to go to jail for manslaughter. My employers question me why I am so twitchy, when a male coworker extended his hand for a handshake I did a weird move, I put my left hand in front of my stomach to kind of shield my soft parts and protect myself, because the only male figure in my life only extends his hands to grope me painfully or sexually, it's a weird reflex for me. My parents have taken up 3 living rooms in the house, yet they choose to spend most of their time in the kitchen, they control the food and food intake, from dining room my drunken piece of shit father always can monitor and control situation in the kitchen, bathroom and of course oversee the precious car keys. My entire life I am being monitored and controlled by my helicopter parenting owners in almost every aspect of my life, even the dumbest shit I manage to accomplish is always received with overexaggerated and worthless compliments from my mother.
</p><p>
In the past, when my father started to grope and pinch me, all I had to do was stand still and express no emotions, he would almost instantly lose interest and leave me alone. After I got in a slight fender bender with a wild animal on my way "home" from work, my father started to demand money from me so that he can replace the car, I asked for help to my superior CFO at work to maybe consider giving me a raise, it got me fired. My father saw this as the moment to show some of his true colors, he gropes me painfully and he keeps doing it because he now enjoys dominating a stupid bitch who can't find a decent job or even hold one that earns me as little as 300 euros a month. (Ok yes technically the highest net income I have ever earned in my lifetime in Latvia was 570 euros a month before taking into account travel expenses, during winter I was spending almost 200 euros a month on gas alone and almost as much for unexpected car repairs, lucky me lives in the rural woods with my incestual family so public transportation is not a luxury for me.) It is haram to retaliate against your owner who is feeding you. I know that showing signs of emotion, expressing pain only gives my owner more satisfaction, I can only stand still and accept my punishment for being a failure at life. I can only fantasize about reaching out for that knife and jamming it down my owners throat, while he gropes me in my mother's kitchen. I know people are disgusted to be involved with mentally crippled adults, but I can promise that in everyday life I try really, really hard to keep all these demons as a secret, I only want employment so that I could try behaving like "normal", independent adult. As my mother claims, it's not really molesting unless a male sticks his dick inside a minor and ejaculates, I've also heard from others that it's technically impossible for a husband to rape his own wife. People born under oppressive regimes are all kinds of fucked up and keep the totalitarian oppression alive in their family. Many of the freedoms and rights are unobtainable for the poor and stupid. I am terrified to bring up words "trade union" to my employer because I believe it will deny me chance to gain or keep employment. One of my middle school teachers would sometimes say that: "This is where your rights end and your duties begin."
</p><p>
I understand that I should spare myself from further abuse and ridicule and simply kill myself, but I am too much of a pussy piece of shit to actually go through with it.
